Have a look at [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) and some state-of-the-art architectures such as [EfficientNet architecture](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/efficientnet-improving-accuracy-and.html). Play around with the possibilities PyTorch offers you and see how close you can get to the [state of the art on CIFAR-10](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10)."
